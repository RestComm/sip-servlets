<h1>The User Interface</h1>
<p>
Under each SIP message you can add the applications in a chain to be called when this message is received. 
The applications will be called in the order you specify unless you explicitly set the <b>Order</b> value.</p>
<p>In order to move an application from one chain to another you can simply drag the blue handle of the application.
to another chain</p>
<p>In order to move a whole chain and associate it with another SIP message, you can drag the red handle to another
column.</p>

<p>As an application router component is essential for the functioning of
the container the following application router logic SHOULD be available
with every container compliant with this specification. The container
implementations MAY chose to provide a much richer application router
component. For the purpose of this discussion the application router
defined in this appendix is termed as Default Application Router (DAR).
</p>

<p>The Application Router and the Container have a simple contract defined
by the <code>SipApplicationRouter</code> interface. <br>

The DAR MUST implement all the methods of that interface as described in
this document.



</p><p><b>The DAR Configuration File</b><br>
The DAR works off a simple configuration text file which is modeled as a
Java properties file:

</p><ul>
<li>The properties file MUST be made available to the DAR and the
location/content of this file MUST be accessible from a hierarchical URI
which itself is to be supplied as a system property "javax.servlet.sip.dar.configuration"
 </li>
<li>The propeties file has a simple format in which the name of the
property is the SIP method and the value is a simple comma separated
stringified value for the SipRouterInfo object.
<pre>     INVITE: (sip-router-info-1), (sip-router-info-2)..
     SUBSCRIBE:  (sip-router-info-3), (sip-router-info-4)..
</pre>
</li>
<li> The properties file is first read by the DAR when the
<code>init()</code> is first called on the DAR. The arguments passed in the

<code>init()</code> are ignored. </li>
<li> The properties file is refreshed each time
<code>applicationDeployed()</code> or <code>applicationUndeployed()</code>
is called. Similar to <code>init()</code>, the argument of these two invocations are ignored, these callbacks act just as a trigger to read the file afresh.
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>

<p> The sip-router-info data that goes in the properties file is a
stringified version of the SipRouterInfo object. It consists of the
following information :
</p><ul>
<li>The name of the application as known to the container</li>
<li>The identity of the subscriber that the DAR returns. It can return any
header in the SIP request using the DAR directive DAR:<i>SIP_HEADER</i> e.g
"DAR:From" would return the sip uri in From header. Or alternatively it can
return any string.</li>
<li>The routing region, one of the strings "ORIGINATING", "TERMINATING" or
"NEUTRAL"</li>
<li>A SIP URI indicating the route as returned by the application route, it
can be an empty string. </li>
<li>A route modifier which can be any one of the strings "ROUTE",
"NO_ROUTE", or "CLEAR_ROUTE" </li>
<li>A string representing stateInfo. As stateInfo is for application
router's internal use only, what goes in this is up to the individual DAR
implementations. As a hint the stateInfo could contain the index into the
list of sip-router-info that was returned last. </li>

</ul>

<p></p>
<p> Following is an example of the DAR configuration file:
</p><pre>INVITE: ("OriginatingCallWaiting", "DAR:From", "ORIGINATING", "",
"NO_ROUTE", "0"), ("CallForwarding", "DAR:To", "TERMINATING", "",
"NO_ROUTE", "1")
</pre>
In this example, the DAR is setup to invoke two applications on INVITE
request, one each in the originating and the terminating half. The
applications are identified by their names as defined in the application
deployment descriptors and used here. The subscriber identity returned in
this case is the URI from the From and To header respectively for the two
applications. The DAR does not return any route to the container and
maintains the invocation state in the stateInfo as the index of the last
application in the list. 

<p><b>The DAR Operation</b><br>


The key interaction point between the Container and the Application Router
is the method
</p><pre>SipApplicationRouterInfo getNextApplication
    (SipServletRequest initialRequest,
      SipApplicationRoutingRegion region,
      SipApplicationRoutingDirective directive,
      java.lang.String stateInfo);
</pre>

This method is invoked when an initial request is received by the
container. When this method is invoked on DAR it will make use of the
stateInfo and the initialRequest parameters and find out what SIP method is
in the request. Next it will create the object <code>

SipApplicationRouterInfo</code> from the sip-router-info information in the
properties file, starting from the first in the list. The stateInfo could
contain the index of the last sip-router-info returned so on next
invocation of getNextApplication the DAR proceeds to the next sip-router-
info in the list. The order of declaration of sip-router-info becomes
the priority order of invocation.

<p> As you would notice, this is a minimalist application router with no processing logic besides the declaration of the application order. It is expected that in real world deployments, the application router shall play an extremely important role in application orchestration and composition. It is likely to make use of complex rules and diverse data repositories. The DAR is intended to be a very simple implementation that is available as part of the reference implementation, and could be used instead of a real world application router.
