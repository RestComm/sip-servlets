Doing a Release : 

Checkout the branch and do mvn release:prepare -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true from there
when asked for SCM release tag, put release-<version-number>
if thet svn tag fails, do a svn update then retry  mvn release:prepare -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true (it won't prompt you for anything since it has already everything from the previous failed one) -> this problem is mainly due to compatibility issue between mvn and svn 1.5

Update your local jboss repo or create one if that is not already done (See http://wiki.jboss.org/auth/wiki/MavenReleaseRepository and ask Paul Gier to add you in the authorized list to upload to the main JBoss repository)

mvn release:perform -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true, 
(if that fails (usually due to sip servlets management console don't know why) do cd target/checkout, and then mvn deploy -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true or upgrade to maven 2.1.0+)

Go into your local jboss repo and add and commit all artifacts corresponding to the release that has been done.

Go to http://hudson.qa.jboss.com/hudson/job/MobicentsSipServletsRelease/configure and make a release based on the new tag corresponding to the release that has just been made.



Creating a branch form a Tag : 
checkout the tag and do 
mvn release:branch -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DbranchName=0.9.X -DupdateBranchVersions=true -DupdateWorkingCopyVersions=false
(replace branchName by the correct version)
if thet svn branch creation fails, do a svn update then retry  mvn release:branch -P release -Dmaven.test.skip=true -DbranchName=0.9.X -DupdateBranchVersions=true -DupdateWorkingCopyVersions=false 
(it will prompt you again for the versions so make sure you use the same ones or it will fail) -> this problem is mainly due to compatibility issue between mvn and svn 1.5

Maven will unfortunately commit the version change to the tag as well so we need to revert to the previous version used by the tag
svn merge -rHEAD:5694 https://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/tags/servers/sip-servlets/release-0.9 ./
(replace the 5694 with the rev number where the version was correct ie without the SNAPSHOT => 0.9)
then we need to commit them back with 
svn commit -m "maven committed the version change on the tag... => rollback to the previous version of the poms"

Then we need to move the branch creation to the correct location and we are done
svn copy https://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/branches/0.9.X/ https://mobicents.googlecode.com/svn/branches/servers/sip-servlets/0.9.X/ -m "copy of the 0.9.X branch to the right location"
