  <title>JRuby/Rails Integration with Torquebox Telco Framework</title>
  <para>Mobicents Sip Servlets is compatible with the <ulink url="http://torquebox.org/">Torquebox</ulink> Telco Framework. The framework allows you to create powerful, pure or converged VoIP JRuby on Rails applications using the same model as Sip Servlets and allowing for Media Control.</para>
  <para>JRuby features a powerful and well
  deployed scripting language that allows you to modify your application at
  runtime (this is true even for the SIP and Media part that Mobicents Sip
  Servlets offer) without restarting the server.  In addition, TorqueBox is a new kind of Ruby application
  platform that integrates popular technologies such as Ruby-on-Rails, while
  extending the footprint of Ruby applications to include support for Job
  Scheduling, Task Queues, SOAP Handling, and other capabilities.</para>

  leverage Mobicents SIP Servlets SIP and mediat capabilities, refer to the <ulink url="http://torquebox.org/documentation/browse/LATEST/telecom.html">Torquebox User Documentation</ulink>.</para>
