Pure JRuby on Rails Sip Servlets application that can <make and receive phone calls>

* Service Description

	The application will allow one to file complaints and every time a complaint is filed, 
	a confirmation call is made to your phone saying that is has been taken into account and has been routed to a sales representative.\
	Moreover you can call directly the application and the pure jruby application will be able to handle the SIP signalling and setup and teardown the call. 
	 
Pre requisites :

JRuby 1.2.0+
	 
Build the application :

1. modify the ruby-teclo-app-rails.yml located in this directory to map the RAILS_ROOT variable to where this application is located on your filesystem

Now let's freeze the rails version and the associated gems dependencies we are using into our application so that if rails or a dependency is upgraded in the system, our application will always use the version we freezed and not the newly upgraded version of rails from the system. Note: this is highly recommended for production env and really is a best practice (google freeze rails for more information)
Note that freezing is mandatory if you wish to deploy your application to JBoss 5 with the jboss-rails plugin.

It is a 2 steps process, first freeze rails then the dependencies (in our case the jdbcmysql adapter)
Here is the command to freeze your rails application :

 jruby -S rake rails:freeze:gems

Here is the command

jruby -S rake gems:unpack:dependencies

You can verify that it worked by issuing this command

 jruby -S rake gems

That will produce the following output :

 - [F] activerecord-jdbcmysql-adapter = 0.9
   - [F] activerecord-jdbc-adapter = 0.9
   - [F] jdbc-mysql = 5.0.4

I = Installed
F = Frozen
R = Framework (loaded before rails starts)

Let's add torquebox-support to the application so that it can be deployed and run on JBoss 5 and even start JBoss 5 from the commandline, grab the following zip http://repo.oddthesis.org/maven2/SNAPSHOTS/org/jboss/rails/jboss-rails/1.0.0.Beta7-SNAPSHOT/jboss-rails-1.0.0.Beta7-20090408.124930-1-support.zip and extract it to the vendor/plugins directory of our application.

Run the application

1. deploy to Mobicents Sip Servlets on JBoss 5 (build 306 at least) from http://hudson.jboss.org/hudson/view/Mobicents/job/MobicentsSipServletsRelease/ :
cp ruby-teclo-app-rails.yml $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy
2. copy the contents of the pure-jruby-telco.properties dar file into $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/mobicents-dar.properties
3. Start jboss with sh $JBOSS_HOME/bin/run.sh
4. Start your sip phone
5. go to http://localhost:8080/pure-jruby-telco/complaints
6. Create a new complaint and make sure that in the sip uri field you put the address of the sip phone (sip:jean@127.0.0.1:5090 by example)

Alternatively you can also call directly the application by dialing sip:whatever@127.0.0.1:5080 from your sip phone.
